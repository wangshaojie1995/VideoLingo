# üöÄ Getting Started

## üìã API Configuration
This project requires Large Language Models and TTS. For best quality, please use claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620 with Azure TTS. Recommended to use [302AI](https://gpt302.saaslink.net/C2oHR9), which offers both LLM and TTS services with a single API key. You can also choose a fully local experience by using Ollama for LLM and Edge TTS for dubbing, with no API key required (In this case, you need to set `max_workers` to 1 and `summary_length` low to 2000 in `config.yaml`).

### 1. **Get API_KEY for Large Language Models**:

| Recommended Model | Recommended Provider | base_url | Price | Effect |
|:-----|:---------|:---------|:-----|:---------|
| gemini-2.0-flash-exp | [302AI](https://gpt302.saaslink.net/C2oHR9) | https://api.302.ai | $0.3 / 1M tokens | ü•≥ |
| claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620 | [302AI](https://gpt302.saaslink.net/C2oHR9) | https://api.302.ai | $15 / 1M tokens | ü§© |
| deepseek-coder | [302AI](https://gpt302.saaslink.net/C2oHR9) | https://api.302.ai | ¬•2 / 1M tokens | üòÉ |
| qwen2.5-coder:32b | [Ollama](https://ollama.ai) | http://localhost:11434 | Local | üòÉ |

Note: Supports OpenAI interface, you can try different models. However, the process involves multi-step reasoning chains and complex JSON formats, **not recommended to use models smaller than 30B**.

### 2. **TTS API**
VideoLingo provides multiple TTS integration methods. Here's a comparison (skip if only using translation without dubbing)

| TTS Solution | Provider | Pros | Cons | Chinese Effect | Non-Chinese Effect |

| üîä Azure TTS ‚≠ê | [302AI](https://gpt302.saaslink.net/C2oHR9) | Natural effect | Limited emotions | ü§© | üòÉ |
| üéôÔ∏è OpenAI TTS | [302AI](https://gpt302.saaslink.net/C2oHR9) | Realistic emotions | Chinese sounds foreign | üòï | ü§© |

| üó£ Edge TTS | Local | Completely free | Average effect | üòê | üòê |
| üó£Ô∏è GPT-SoVITS | Local | Best voice cloning | Only supports Chinese/English, requires local inference, complex setup | üèÜ | üö´ |

- For SiliconFlow FishTTS, get key from [SiliconFlow](https://cloud.siliconflow.cn/i/ttKDEsxE), note that cloning feature requires paid credits;
- For OpenAI TTS, Azure TTS, and Fish TTS, use [302AI](https://gpt302.saaslink.net/C2oHR9) - one API key provides access to all three services

<summary>SiliconFlow FishTTS Tutorial</summary>

Currently supports 3 modes:

1. `preset`: Uses fixed voice, can preview on [Official Playground](https://cloud.siliconflow.cn/playground/text-to-speech/17885302608), default is `anna`.
2. `clone(stable)`: Corresponds to fishtts api's `custom`, uses voice from uploaded audio, automatically samples first 10 seconds of video for voice, better voice consistency.
3. `clone(dynamic)`: Corresponds to fishtts api's `dynamic`, uses each sentence as reference audio during TTS, may have inconsistent voice but better effect.

<summary>How to choose OpenAI voices?</summary>

Voice list can be found on the [official website](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-to-speech/voice-options), such as `alloy`, `echo`, `nova`, etc. Modify `openai_tts.voice` in `config.yaml`.

</details>
<details>
<summary>How to choose Azure voices?</summary>

Recommended to try voices in the [online demo](https://speech.microsoft.com/portal/voicegallery). You can find the voice code in the code on the right, e.g. `zh-CN-XiaoxiaoMultilingualNeural`

</details>

<details>
<summary>How to choose Fish TTS voices?</summary>

Go to the [official website](https://fish.audio/en/) to listen and choose voices. Find the voice code in the URL, e.g. Dingzhen is `54a5170264694bfc8e9ad98df7bd89c3`. Popular voices are already added in `config.yaml`. To use other voices, modify the `fish_tts.character_id_dict` dictionary in `config.yaml`.

<summary>GPT-SoVITS-v2 Tutorial</summary>

1. Check requirements and download the package from [official Yuque docs](https://www.yuque.com/baicaigongchang1145haoyuangong/ib3g1e/dkxgpiy9zb96hob4#KTvnO).

2. Place `GPT-SoVITS-v2-xxx` and `VideoLingo` in the same directory. **Note they should be parallel folders.**

3. Choose one of the following ways to configure the model:

   a. Self-trained model:
   - After training, `tts_infer.yaml` under `GPT-SoVITS-v2-xxx\GPT_SoVITS\configs` will have your model path auto-filled. Copy and rename it to `your_preferred_english_character_name.yaml`
   - In the same directory as the `yaml` file, place reference audio named `your_preferred_english_character_name_reference_audio_text.wav` or `.mp3`, e.g. `Huanyuv2_Hello, this is a test audio.wav`
   - In VideoLingo's sidebar, set `GPT-SoVITS Character` to `your_preferred_english_character_name`.

   b. Use pre-trained model:
   - Download my model from [here](https://vip.123pan.cn/1817874751/8137723), extract and overwrite to `GPT-SoVITS-v2-xxx`.
   - Set `GPT-SoVITS Character` to `Huanyuv2`.

   c. Use other trained models:
   - Place `xxx.ckpt` in `GPT_weights_v2` folder and `xxx.pth` in `SoVITS_weights_v2` folder.
   - Following method a, rename `tts_infer.yaml` and modify `t2s_weights_path` and `vits_weights_path` under `custom` to point to your models, e.g.:
  
      ```yaml
      # Example config for method b:
      t2s_weights_path: GPT_weights_v2/Huanyu_v2-e10.ckpt
      version: v2
      vits_weights_path: SoVITS_weights_v2/Huanyu_v2_e10_s150.pth
      ```
   - Following method a, place reference audio in the same directory as the `yaml` file, named `your_preferred_english_character_name_reference_audio_text.wav` or `.mp3`, e.g. `Huanyuv2_Hello, this is a test audio.wav`. The program will auto-detect and use it.
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: **Please use English for `character_name`** to avoid errors. `reference_audio_text` can be in Chinese. Currently in beta, may produce errors.

   # Expected directory structure:

       ‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ your_preferred_english_character_name_reference_audio_text.wav
       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ GPT_weights_v2

           ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [your SoVITS model file]
   ```
        
After configuration, select `Reference Audio Mode` in the sidebar (see Yuque docs for details). During dubbing, VideoLingo will automatically open GPT-SoVITS inference API port in the command line, which can be closed manually after completion. Note that stability depends on the base model chosen.</details>

## üõ†Ô∏è Quick Start

VideoLingo supports Windows, macOS and Linux systems, and can run on CPU or GPU.

> **Note:** To use NVIDIA GPU acceleration on Windows, please complete the following steps first:
> 1. Install [CUDA Toolkit 12.6](https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/12.6.0/local_installers/cuda_12.6.0_560.76_windows.exe)
> 2. Install [CUDNN 9.3.0](https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cudnn/9.3.0/local_installers/cudnn_9.3.0_windows.exe)
> 3. Add `C:\Program Files\NVIDIA\CUDNN\v9.3\bin\12.6` to your system PATH
> 4. Restart your computer

> **Note:** FFmpeg is required. Please install it via package managers:
> - Windows: ```choco install ffmpeg``` (via [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/))
> - macOS: ```brew install ffmpeg``` (via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/))
> - Linux: ```sudo apt install ffmpeg``` (Debian/Ubuntu) or ```sudo dnf install ffmpeg``` (Fedora)

Before installing VideoLingo, ensure you have installed Git and Anaconda.

1. Clone the project:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Huanshere/VideoLingo.git
   cd VideoLingo
   ```

2. Create and activate virtual environment (**must be python=3.10.0**):
   ```bash
   conda create -n videolingo python=3.10.0 -y
   conda activate videolingo
   ```

3. Run installation script:
   ```bash
   python install.py
   ```

4. üéâ Launch Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run st.py
   ```

5. Set key in sidebar of popup webpage and start using~

   ![tutorial](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/983ba58b-5ae3-4132-90f5-6d48801465dd)

6. (Optional) More settings can be manually modified in `config.yaml`, watch command line output during operation. To use custom terms, add them to `custom_terms.xlsx` before processing, e.g. `Baguette | French bread | Not just any bread!`.

## üè≠ Batch Mode (beta)

Documentation: [English](/batch/README.md) | [Chinese](/batch/README.zh.md)

## üö® Common Errors

1. **'All array must be of the same length' or 'Key Error' during translation**: 
   - Reason 1: Weaker models have poor JSON format compliance causing response parsing errors.
   - Reason 2: LLM may refuse to translate sensitive content.
   Solution: Check `response` and `msg` fields in `output/gpt_log/error.json`, delete the `output/gpt_log` folder and retry.

2. **'Retry Failed', 'SSL', 'Connection', 'Timeout'**: Usually network issues. Solution: Users in mainland China please switch network nodes and retry.

3. **local_files_only=True**: Model download failure due to network issues, need to verify network can ping `huggingface.co`.
